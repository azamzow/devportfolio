                        I graduated from Sam Houston State University in May 2018 as a student athlete with a degree in Computer Science. 
                        I later became an intern for Feniex Industries where I worked with the engineering and marketing departments. 
                        I am a full stack software developer currently seeking a career opportunity where I can add value to a company 
                        while also expanding and developing my knowledge base. I design, develop, troubleshoot, and debug software programs, 
                        for databases, applications, tools, networks, etc. <br /><br />

                        From the experience I’ve gained at Feniex and being a student-athlete in college, I’ve learned how to 
                        effectively work with a team, while being a reliable asset. My drive and positive attitude is what separates me 
                        from the rest and also prepares me for any area outside my comfort zone.   <br /><br />

                <h4>Software Developer Intern</h4>
                <p>
                    Feniex is a manufacturing company that produces light and sound equipment for emergency, off road, and public work vehicles. Their
                    products apply to police, fire, EMS, construction vehicles and more.<br />
                    I started my internship working with the engineering department. Using React Native, I repaired an abandoned application, then updated it to have 
                    the correct products and features for company and customer use.(Read more about the App below)
                    After completing the app, I joined the marketing department where I assisted the web team in developing a brand new platform for their website called Build-A-Bar
                    (Read more about Build-A-Bar below). This web application was built using Angular for the front-end and Druple for the back-end.

                <p>
                    Feniex was at a changing point to becoming full ecommerce.
                    That being said, my first project was reskinning the current 60 product pages on the website to resemble direct to consumer. After completing the new changes, I 
                    then implement FedEx's software API tracking system into the site so customers can track orders. Next, I developed a brand new platform called Build-A-Bar, which is 
                    a one-of-a-kind customizable software to build ones own lightbar/lightstick. Later joining the engineering team, I built an innovative software within Feniex's new controller.
                    The controller software interprets JSON packets received from the OBD2 and the relay, which controls global states based on the users programmable input. This allows the 
                    user to control all the lights and sirens in their vehical however they wish.

                        <h3>Code Chat</h3>
                        <p>
                             During my senior year, I worked with a 9-man team to design and build a project that could benefit programmers all over the world. 
                             Before developing CodeChat, my peers and I 
                             were having trouble sharing compiled code with each other. 
                             Since there was no code sharing platform on the market that was
                             chat friendly, we decided to build the application ourselves.
                             This allows users to see the compiled code immediately
                             so that there is a faster learning experience. <br/>
                            I was the assistant programmer for most of the
                            JavaScript modules within the back-end. Our whole system utilizes websockets between the webapp, the chat server,
                            and the compiling server, making it as network performant as possible.

                        <h3>Feniex Module Programmer</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Feniex Module Programmer helps users program Feniex lights via bluetooth. This app requires the purchase of a Feniex Module Programmer (hardware) and also at least
                            one Feniex light product to function. 
                            Once the user is bluetooth connected to the module programmer, you can test and confirm multiple lighting pattern switches on ones light product.
                            It is Android and IOS compatible.<br/>
                            Working in someone else's code and style definitly started this project off with a challenge. However, after I 
                            quickly overcame that, I was able to debug the app finding out the core of the issues. The IOS and Android application both call  to the React Native code that uses Redux states.
                            Some of the states were not being used correctly in the app. Once I solved that issue, I added a settings button so the user can have more control over the app. 
                            Lastly, I added new products so the user can have the latest version of usability.

                        <h3>Build-A-Bar</h3>
                        <p>
                            Build-A-Bar is a way to design and personalize your own emergency lightbar. The user begins with two options, single or dual color. 
                            The dual option allows reversal of the LED's and specific color coordination’s such as "Dual Flood" or "Amber Arrow". Color coordination differs within each product.
                            The user can then 'build a bar'. Build-A-Bar is unique because no other emergency lighting company provides customization like this.<br/>
                            This project was built using Angular, JavaScript in the frontend, and Drupal for the framework.  Each bar's information is stored using an object. Once an object is created it gets pushed in an array.
                            When the bar is complete, the array is sorted using bubble sort and is sent to the manufacturing department. The user also has the option to download a PDF of their 
                            built bar. This ensures that each order is accurate.

                        As a dynamic professional with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Sam Houston State University, coupled with
                        extensive experience in software development, I bring a blend of technical expertise and collaborative spirit to every
                        project. My journey began as a student-athlete, where I cultivated a strong work ethic and a passion for teamwork,
                        attributes that have continued to define my approach in the professional sphere.
                        
                        During my tenure as an intern at Feniex Industries and subsequently as a Software Developer at HNTB, I have honed my
                        skills in full-stack software development, specializing in designing, developing, troubleshooting, and debugging robust
                        software programs across a variety of platforms. In addition to my technical roles, I also serve as the Mentorship
                        Program Coordinator for the SCTX region at HNTB, where I facilitate professional development opportunities and
                        mentorship initiatives for our team members, fostering a culture of growth and collaboration.

                        ASP.NET, and other cutting-edge technologies to develop innovative solutions tailored to meet the unique needs of our
                        clients.
                        
                        Beyond technical acumen, my experience has equipped me with invaluable soft skills, including effective communication,
                        adaptability, and a positive attitude, all of which are instrumental in fostering collaborative environments and driving
                        project success. Whether mentoring junior engineers, participating in code reviews, or liaising with stakeholders, I am

                        I am passionate about continuous learning and growth, and I am eager to explore new opportunities that will allow me to
                        further expand my knowledge base and contribute to impactful projects. With a proven track record of success and a

                        <h3>Code Chat</h3>
                        <p>
                             During my senior year, I worked with a 9-man team to design and build a project that could benefit programmers all over the world. 
                             Before developing CodeChat, my peers and I 
                             were having trouble sharing compiled code with each other. 
                             Since there was no code sharing platform on the market that was
                             chat friendly, we decided to build the application ourselves.
                             This allows users to see the compiled code immediately
                             so that there is a faster learning experience. <br/>
                            I was the assistant programmer for most of the
                            JavaScript modules within the back-end. Our whole system utilizes websockets between the webapp, the chat server,
                            and the compiling server, making it as network performant as possible.

                        <h3>Feniex Module Programmer</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Feniex Module Programmer helps users program Feniex lights via bluetooth. This app requires the purchase of a Feniex Module Programmer (hardware) and also at least
                            one Feniex light product to function. 
                            Once the user is bluetooth connected to the module programmer, you can test and confirm multiple lighting pattern switches on ones light product.
                            It is Android and IOS compatible.<br/>
                            Working in someone else's code and style definitly started this project off with a challenge. However, after I 
                            quickly overcame that, I was able to debug the app finding out the core of the issues. The IOS and Android application both call  to the React Native code that uses Redux states.
                            Some of the states were not being used correctly in the app. Once I solved that issue, I added a settings button so the user can have more control over the app. 
                            Lastly, I added new products so the user can have the latest version of usability.

                        <p>
                            Build-A-Bar is a way to design and personalize your own emergency lightbar. The user begins with two options, single or dual color. 
                            The dual option allows reversal of the LED's and specific color coordination’s such as "Dual Flood" or "Amber Arrow". Color coordination differs within each product.
                            The user can then 'build a bar'. Build-A-Bar is unique because no other emergency lighting company provides customization like this.<br/>
                            This project was built using Angular, JavaScript in the frontend, and Drupal for the framework.  Each bar's information is stored using an object. Once an object is created it gets pushed in an array.
                            When the bar is complete, the array is sorted using bubble sort and is sent to the manufacturing department. The user also has the option to download a PDF of their 
                            built bar. This ensures that each order is accurate.
